            Justin Lavash (born London 1968) has been based in
            Prague for fifteen years and during that time has established
            himself as a must-see act on the Czech music scene and abroad.
            His music crosses borders - somewhere between blues, folk and
            jazz. His phenomenal guitar playing has left many audiences
            wondering how so much polyphony can be made by one man on
            one instrument. Lavash identifies himself as a fingerstyle
            guitarist, following in the footsteps of British folk guitar gurus
            like Richard Thompson or John Martyn, but he is of a younger
            generation and traces of New Wave and even dance culture can
            be found in his music. Prior to living in the Czech Republic
            Lavash worked as a guitarist in south London's jazz scene in the
            90s and later cabaret scene, both as a guitarist and a
            transcriber.

            His deep, soulful voice entices the listener to sit and absorb the beautiful songs this
            artist has penned. In fact his skills as a performer are matched with his talents as a
            songwriter. He has written or co-written and performed songs by some of the Czech
            Republic's most repected artists - Lenka Dusilova ("Brother" on Baromantika and
            "Mayday" on V hodine smrtii), Michal Horacek ("Dizzy and stranded in Prague"
            from Cesky Kalendar), Sunflower Caravan ("A little bit more"), Monika Naceva
            ("Milostny Slabiky") and he has also worked with Raduza (Marathon), DG307 and
            Vladimir Merta. Two of his songs ("Brother" and " Dizzy and stranded in Prague"
            were on releases which received prizes in the Czech gramophone industry's Andel
            awards in 2012 and 2013.

            His 2015 studio album, Changing of Tides (Tranzistor, May 2015) saw Lavash flexing some songwriting muscle, and moves through
            genres like blues, country, jazz, funk and soul with breathtaking ease. His 2016 release Programmed saw an audacious fusion of
            bottleneck blues and electronica styles and earned top marks in The Czech Republic’s prestigious Reflex magazine as well as
            extensive airplay on Prague’s Radio 1 among others. Despite some serious health problems, Lavash continues to play concerts on a
            busy schedule. His recent releases - Live in Prague 2015, Live in Prague 2 (2018) - confirm why his concerts are so highly praised.
